    <p>My name is Rio Wickham and I am a first year student at SETU Waterford studying to get my BSc (Hons) in Software Systems Development. I am living in Waterford and only moved here in September, I am orignally from Naas, Co. Kildare and studied in Naas CBS for 6 years. </p>
    <p>What I hope to gain from getting this degree is to hopefully pursue a Masters degree in Software Development or Software Engineering and then get the opportuinity to travel the world working from home and go on to reach a great job height and make a name for myself.</p>
    <p>I have made some great connections from the working world througout the last 2 years and have been building myself up for the opportunities with experience since I was 16 years old. This can be seen from my LinkedIn below. </p>
