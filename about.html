    <h2> About this project </h2>
    <p>The main plan and design of this website took me a week to figure out but in the end it has ended up exceeding my expectations and I have put alot of work into making it look as presentable as possible</p>
    <p>The first thing I had to decide on was the color scheme and background image for my sit, I decided on a picture of the setu building as my background image as it is a great representation of what my life is currently like in college. The next desicsion I had to make was what my main background colour for my text was going to be, I decided on the color "azure" as it is a nice light colour that blends well with the background and text colour.</p>
    <p>I next had to decide on the structure and layout of the website, I decided on a framework of a hotbar on the top for the different page with a work-down design of significance of text, with the top being the assignment, next page name ect.</p>
    <p>Deciding on my pages was the next big descision I had to make as it was going to be very important for the page, I used a mix of personal information in my about me section, some relational information in the hobbies and achievements and then project information in this page and the introduction.</p>
    <p>And finally, how I made the page. So I started with testing different colour codes to see what worked best on the page for the background, after that I worked on the links and styling of the links to make them as attractive and user friendly as possible, I then worked on the styling of my text using background colours, opacity, font style, font weight ect. I then worked on dividing the CSS into sectoins and working on each part of my code and how I wanted the final product to work, grouping some together such as p with h2 as they are close and would work nicer if they looked similar. Finally I filled out each page with the designated text and used images to enhance the user expeirence and allow them to be able to get a better desctiption and added a table to once again enhance the readability for the user and finish my styling the table in CSS. The final product of this web page was very good for me and I am very happy with how everything has turned out.</p>
